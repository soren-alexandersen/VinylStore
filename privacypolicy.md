**Privacy Policy for Vinyl Sessions**

*Last updated: November 16 2025*

Vinyl Sessions (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is a personal Vinyl Sessions app designed to help you manage your own music library on your own devices. We take your privacy seriously and aim to collect and process as little personal data as possible.

This Privacy Policy explains what information the app processes, how it is used, and what control you have.

If you have any questions, you can contact us at soren@friis.io

**1. Overview**

We do not run our own servers that store your Vinyl Sessions data.

Your Vinyl Sessions, notes, ratings and related information are stored:

Locally on your device, and

Optionally in your own iCloud account if you enable iCloud sync.

We do not sell, rent, or share your data with advertisers.

We do not use third-party advertising SDKs or tracking tools.

Some limited information may be processed by Apple and by external services that help identify albums (for example, album cover recognition or music databases). Those services use their own privacy policies.

**2. Information we process**
**2.1 Collection data you enter**

Vinyl Sessions lets you store information about your vinyl records, such as:

Album title, artist, genre, year/decade

Condition/grade of vinyl and cover

Notes, tags, wishlist items

Dates you added items

Any other fields you choose to fill in

Where this data lives:

On-device: Stored locally in the app’s database on your device.

iCloud / CloudKit (optional): If you enable iCloud sync, your data is stored in your private iCloud account and synced between your devices using Apple’s CloudKit service.

We as the developer do not have direct access to your private iCloud database contents.

**2.2 Album recognition & external services**

When you use features such as:

Scanning an album cover with the camera to identify it, or

Fetching album metadata (for example from public music databases or APIs),
the app may send some information to third-party services, for example:

An image of the album cover

Artist or album name search queries

Basic technical request data (IP address, user agent, etc., handled by those services)

This is done only to identify the album and retrieve metadata (title, artist, artwork, etc.). We do not use these services to create marketing profiles or track you across other apps.

These third-party services operate under their own privacy policies.

**2.3 Diagnostics & crash data**

Depending on your device settings, Apple may collect anonymous crash reports and diagnostics for apps, including Vinyl Sessions.

If you choose to share this data with app developers in your iOS settings:

We may see aggregated crash logs and performance data provided by Apple.

This information is used only to fix bugs and improve stability.

We do not use it to identify you personally.

We do not currently integrate any additional third-party analytics SDKs.

**3. How we use your data**

We use the information processed by Vinyl Sessions strictly to:

Provide core functionality (managing your Vinyl Sessions and wishlist)

Recognize albums and fetch metadata when you request it

Sync your collection between your devices via iCloud, if enabled

Improve the app’s reliability and fix bugs (via anonymous diagnostics/crash data)

We do not:

Sell your data to third parties

Use your data for targeted advertising

Build marketing profiles about you

**4. Data storage and security**
**4.1 On your device**

Your collection data is stored locally on your device in the app’s private storage. iOS protects this storage with its built-in security features (sandboxing, device encryption, etc.).

**4.2 iCloud / CloudKit (if enabled)**

If you turn on iCloud sync:

Your data is stored in your private iCloud account, managed by Apple.

Data is transmitted and stored using Apple’s iCloud/CloudKit infrastructure.

We do not control Apple’s servers and do not have direct access to your iCloud data.

For more information about Apple’s privacy practices, please see Apple’s privacy policy.

**5. Your choices and controls**

Within the app and your device settings, you can:

Add, edit and delete items in your collection at any time.

Disable iCloud sync (if enabled) in the app or in iOS settings; new changes will then stay on the device only.

Delete the app from your device:

This removes the app and its local data from the device.

Data previously stored in iCloud may remain in your iCloud account until removed according to Apple’s policies.

If you would like us to assist with data questions related to the app, you can contact us at [Contact Email]. Note that we may not be able to see or access the contents of your collection if it lives only in your iCloud/private storage.

**6. Children’s privacy**

Vinyl Sessions is not directed to children under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information through the app, please contact us so we can help you understand what data may be stored on the device or in iCloud.

**7. Third-party links and services**

Vinyl Sessions may use or link to third-party services (such as music databases or APIs) only for functionality like album identification and metadata lookup. These services have their own privacy policies and practices, which we do not control.

We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any third-party services you use through the app.

**8. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example if we:

Add new features

Start using additional services

Introduce optional paid features that change how data is processed

Need to comply with new legal requirements

When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top. Significant changes may also be announced in the app or via release notes.
